 ##Election Summary
 This particular script showed the breakdown by counties and what the candidates received in total from the election. When it comes to future elctions, this can be modified for the whole state/states during a federal election. When it comes to local elections within the cities, the script can be modified for that as well. 
 The .csv files would need to be modified in order to accomidate the differing results and or new .csv files would need to be made and then pushed into the code, allowing it to run and show the results that are required.
 Utilizing the results from this script, campaign managers can stratagize with their candidate as to where they need to go specifically to gain a winning result and if they wnat to get even more specific, certain demographics can also be put into a script in order to gain a better understanding of who is voting and where.
